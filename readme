IMDb Movie Ratings Analysis
This data science project explores trends in IMDb movie ratings, genres, and other key factors using data from the IMDb dataset.
By combining exploratory data analysis with visualizations, we identify genre distribution patterns, examine relationships between ratings and revenue, and explore how success indicators correlate with audience ratings.
The project uses real-world IMDb data and includes visualizations, descriptive statistics, and processed datasets for further analysis.
